> A financial freedom calculator. - v0.1.6


Egonomy is a personal financial spreadsheet aimed to help users calculate their passive income, total income and total expenses in order to measure their level of financial freedom. The basic theory states that if your passive income is greater than your monthly expenses, you are financially free.

- Passive Income: Income generated without investing any time on it (Interests/Dividends + Real Estate/Business).
- Active Income: Income generated by time invested (Salary.)
- Total Income: Passive income plus active income.
- Total Expenses: Total monthly expenses from all sources.


The template is inspired by the sheets used on the boardgame, but adapted to be modular by the user.
